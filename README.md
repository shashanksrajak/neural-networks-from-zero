# Neural Networks

A hands-on learning project for understanding neural network fundamentals from scratch.

## Project Structure

- [`main.py`](main.py) - Main entry point
- [`hands-on/1-scratch.ipynb`](hands-on/1-scratch.ipynb) - Interactive notebook covering neural network basics and perceptron implementation
- [`karpathy-lectures/`](karpathy-lectures/) - Following along with Karpathy's educational content

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook hands-on/1-scratch.ipynb
   ```

## What's Covered

- **Perceptron Basics**: Understanding weight matrices, bias terms, and forward propagation
- **Matrix Operations**: Using NumPy for efficient neural network computations
- **From Scratch Implementation**: Building neural networks without high-level frameworks

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Jupyter for interactive notebooks

Perfect for beginners wanting to understand the math and mechanics behind neural networks!
